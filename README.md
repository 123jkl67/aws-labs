## AWS Labs

This Github repository contains a collection of AWS labs which i have written. I've attempted to design these labs to be more consistent in these principles

1. Easy to ingest
2. High Order concepts explained
3. Dive Deep as required

Each Lab will be prefixed with a difficulty guide

| Level | Difficulty |
| ----  | ---- |
| 100 | Beginner |
| 200 | Novice |
| 300 | Advanced |
| 400 | Expert |

Generally, level 300 and 400 labs will **not** explain beginner concepts, as these are covered in Level 100 / 200 sections.
